painful thing, not bothering to change my soutions because those were the ones that passed

I have removed the `ConsoleProgram.java` file in akk the directories because they're irrelevant
The indentation got messed up when I doeloaded all the code

(yes some may have spelling and grammar errors but they somehow passed)
